1. Diff between branches
	git diff dev..production (compares with tip)
		OR
	git diff dev...production (compares with common ancestor)

2. Getting and apply diff in files
	git diff  >& my_patch.patch
	git apply my_patch.patch

3. Git revert commit

4. Empty commits
  git commit --allow-empty

  This allows to make a new commit with no actual file change. Usecase: No more random whitespace changes to trigger new builds
